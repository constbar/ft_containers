## ft_containers

project of Ã‰cole 42 where it is necessary to reimplement some stl containers with all their methods in C++ using 98 standard.

these containers work just like the original ones. for the speed of memory allocation in containers, std::allocator is used.

implemented iterators for each container: random access iterator for vector and bidirectional iterator for map (binary search tree) and for set (red black tree).

also for the work of containers were implemented std::pair, std::iterator_traits, std::enable_if and other functions.

### list of containers 

| container | description |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| vector | [std::vector] |
| stack | [std::stack] |
| map | [std::map] |
| set | [std::set] |
